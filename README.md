# High level API to the Ledger Wallet Chrome app

This is the high level JS API to the [Ledger Wallet Chrome](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-wallet-chrome) application. With this API, you can communicate directly with the Chrome app and use embedded features such as requesting an address to receive bitcoins, or send a Bitcoin transaction.

Each call to the API will trigger an UI response to the Chrome app, where the user will be able to validate the request.

Right now, the API is in beta and documentation is not available yet.
